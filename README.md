# Crypto Address Tracker

A real-time cryptocurrency address monitoring application built with Next.js and Convex, designed to track incoming transactions and send webhook notifications.

## Features

- üîê **Secure Authentication**: Password-based authentication using Convex Auth
- üìä **Real-time Transaction Monitoring**: Track incoming USDT transactions on the Tron network
- üîî **Webhook Notifications**: Automated webhook calls when new transactions are detected
- üéØ **Duplicate Prevention**: Robust scheduled function management prevents duplicate monitoring processes
- üìà **Transaction History**: View complete transaction history for monitored addresses
- üîÑ **Automatic Polling**: Configurable polling intervals with error recovery
- üõ°Ô∏è **Verification Codes**: Secure webhook endpoints with verification codes

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and Turbopack
- **Database/Backend**: Convex (real-time database with TypeScript functions)
- **Authentication**: Convex Auth with Password provider
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS)
- **Code Quality**: Biome for linting and formatting
- **Package Manager**: Bun

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and Bun installed
- A Convex account (free tier available)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikeyZhang75/Crypto-Tracker.git
cd crypto-tracker
```

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

1. Set up Convex:

```bash
bunx convex dev
```

This will prompt you to log in to Convex and set up your project.

1. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=<your-convex-deployment-url>
```

1. Run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Architecture

### Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

- **addresses**: Stores crypto addresses with webhook configurations
- **transactions**: Records all detected transactions
- **scheduledFunctions**: Tracks active monitoring processes (prevents duplicates)
- **webhookLogs**: Maintains webhook delivery history

### Scheduled Function Management

The system implements a robust pattern to prevent duplicate scheduled functions:

1. **User Intent vs Runtime State**:

   - `addresses.isListening`: Persistent user preference
   - `scheduledFunctions.status`: Current runtime state

2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Only one monitoring process can run per address

3. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - `restartListeningAddresses`: Restart monitoring after system restarts
   - `cleanupStaleScheduledFunctions`: Clean up crashed processes

### Transaction Monitoring Flow

1. User adds a crypto address with webhook URL
2. Toggle listening to start monitoring
3. System polls TronGrid API every 5 seconds (30s on error)
4. New transactions trigger webhook notifications
5. All transactions are stored with complete history

## API Integration

### TronGrid API

The application uses the TronGrid API to fetch TRC20 (USDT) transactions:

- Endpoint: `https://api.trongrid.io/v1/accounts/{address}/transactions/trc20`
- Filters for USDT contract: `TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t`
- Only processes confirmed incoming transfers

### Webhook Payload

When a new transaction is detected, the following payload is sent:

```json
{
  "transactionId": "string",
  "cryptoType": "USDT",
  "from": "string",
  "to": "string",
  "amount": "string",
  "timestamp": "number",
  "type": "received",
  "verificationCode": "string"
}
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Start production server
bun run start

# Run linter
bun run lint

# Format code
bun run format
```

## Convex Functions

Key Convex functions include:

- `addresses.add`: Add a new address to monitor
- `addresses.toggleListening`: Start/stop monitoring
- `addresses.restartListeningAddresses`: Restart all monitoring after crashes
- `transactions.processTransactionFetch`: Core polling logic
- `webhooks.send`: Webhook delivery with retry logic

## Security Considerations

- All API routes require authentication
- Webhook verification codes prevent unauthorized notifications
- User data isolation ensures privacy
- No sensitive data in logs or error messages
